I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago. All this time I’ve thought you were such a good friend that I’ve let you spend my money as if it was yours."

2,Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate.,You told me you hated him.
3,"Despise me If I do not. Three great ones of the city Off-capped to him, and by the faith of man I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. But he (as loving his own pride and purposes) Evades them with a bombast circumstance And in conclusion Nonsuits my mediators. For “Certes,” says he, “I have already chose my officer.” And what was he? One Michael Cassio, a Florentine (A fellow almost damned in a fair wife) That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows","I do hate

They’re talking about Othello, though they never mention his name.

him, I swear. Three of Venice’s most important noblemen took their hats off to him and asked him humbly to make me his lieutenant, the second in command. And I know my own worth well enough to know I deserve that position. But he wants to have things his own way, so he sidesteps the issue with a lot of military talk and refuses their request. “I’ve already chosen my lieutenant,” he says. And who does he choose? A guy who knows more about numbers than fighting! This guy from Florence named Michael Cassio. He has a pretty wife but he can’t even control her. And he’s definitely never commanded men in battle. He’s got no more hands-on knowledge of warfare than an old woman—unless you count what he’s read in books,"

But he, sir, had th' election And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calmed By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster He (in good time) must his lieutenant be And I, bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.","which any peace-lover can do. His military understanding is all theory, no practice.

5,"Why, there’s no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service. Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to th' first. Now sir, be judge yourself, To love the Moor.","And there’s nothing I can do about it. That’s the curse of military service. You get promoted when someone likes you, not because you’re next in line. Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?"
6,I would not follow him then.,If you don’t like him you should quit.
7,"O sir, content you. I follow him to serve my turn upon him. Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master’s ass Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,","No, calm down. I’m serving under him to take advantage of him. We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed. Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated. They ought to be whipped for being so stupid. But then there’s another kind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but who’s really looking out for himself. By pretending to serve their lords, these men get rich, and when they’ve saved up enough they can be their own masters. Guys like that have soul,"
8,"And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago. Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so, for my peculiar end. For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.","and that’s the kind of guy I am. Let me tell you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago. I may seem to love and obey him, but in fact, I’m just serving him to get what I want. If my outward appearance started reflecting what I really felt, soon enough I’d be wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at. No, it’s better to hide it. I’m not who I appear to be."

Thick-lips

27,"Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse. You’ll have your nephews neigh to you. You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.","My God, sir, you’re stubborn and suspicious. We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter. Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses. Your whole family will be ruined."

But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us. I’d never play pranks on you. If you didn’t allow your daughter to do what she’s doing, then she’s rebelling against you.

36,"(to RODERIGO) Farewell, for I must leave you. It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, Against the Moor.

In which regard,","(to RODERIGO) It’s time for me to say goodbye to you. It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed. The Venetian government might reprimand him for this, but it can’t safely get rid of him, since it needs him urgently for the imminent Cyprus wars. They couldn’t find another man with his abilities to lead their armed forces—not if their souls depended on it. I hate him, but I’ve got to show him signs of loyalty"

Are they married, think you?","It’s true. She’s gone. The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives. Do you think they’re married?"
39,"Truly, I think they are.","Yes, I really think so."
40,"Oh, heaven, how got she out? Oh, treason of the blood! Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?","Oh, heaven, how did she get out? My own flesh and blood rebels against me! Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent. Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray? Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo?"

The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will. No one knows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I come from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman I’ve married. And let me tell you, Iago, if I didn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all. But look at those lights. Who’s coming?"
49,Those are the raisèd father and his friends.,"That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed. You’d better go inside."
50,"Not I, I must be found. My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?","No, I must let them find me. My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me. Is it them?"

54,"What’s the matter, think you?",What do you think he wants?
55,"Something from Cyprus as I may divine. Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels, And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly called for. The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out.","Something about Cyprus. I think it’s important. The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already. They’re very anxious for you to get there. When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you."
56,'Tis well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.,It’s good you found me. I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
57,"Ancient, what makes he here?","Ensign, what’s he doing in there?"
58,"If it prove lawful prize, he’s made for ever.","Tonight he boarded a treasure ship. If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever."
59,I do not understand.,I don’t understand.
60,He’s married.,He’s married.
61,To who?,To whom?
62,"Marry, to—",To—
63,"Come, captain, will you go?",Are you ready?
64,Here comes another troop to seek for you.,Here comes another group looking for you.
65,"It is Brabantio. General, be advised, He comes to bad intent.","It’s Brabantio. Look out, sir. He intends to do something bad to you."
66,Holla! Stand there!,Hey! Stop right there!
67,"Signior, it is the Moor.","Sir, it’s the Moor."
68,"Down with him, thief!","Get him, he’s a thief!"
69,"Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons.","Put away your swords. They’ll get rusty in the dew. Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do."
70,"O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter? For I’ll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunned Would ever have, t' incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.

I therefore apprehend and do attach thee Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.— Lay hold upon him. If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril!","You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter? You devil, you’ve put a spell on her! Anybody with eyes could tell you that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, who’s refused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city, wouldn’t run off with a black thing like you unless she’d been bewitched. You’re something to fear, not to love. It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her. That’s probably what happened, so I’m arresting you.—Arrest this man as a practitioner of black magic. Grab him. If he struggles, use force!"
71,"Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining and the rest. Without a prompter. Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?",Just a minute. I don’t need anyone to tell me when to fight. You’ve accused me of some serious crimes. Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
72,"To prison, till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer.","To prison, until you’re called into court."
73,What if I do obey? Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him?,"What if I do what you say? How would I satisfy the Duke then? His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business."
74,"'Tis true, most worthy signior. The Duke’s in council and your noble self,","It’s true. The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too."
75,"How? The Duke in council? In this time of the night? Bring him away. Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own. Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.","The Duke’s in a meeting? At this time of night? Bring him with us. The law’s on my side. The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own. If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers."
76,There’s no composition in this news That gives them credit.,These reports are inconsistent. You can’t trust them.
77,"Indeed, they are disproportioned. My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.","It’s true, they’re inconsistent. My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships."
78,"And mine, two hundred. But though they jump not on a just account— As in these cases, where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.","And mine say two hundred. But often in these cases, reports are just estimates. The important thing is that they all say a Turkish fleet is approaching Cyprus."
79,"I do not so secure me in the error, But the main article I do approve In fearful sense.","Yes, we get the idea. The inconsistency doesn’t make me think that the reports are all wrong. I have no doubt about what they’re basically saying, and it’s frightening."
80,"(within) What, ho, what, ho, what, ho!","(offstage) Hello! Hey, hello!"
81,"Now, what’s the business?",Why are you here?
82,"The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes, So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo.","Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkish fleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus."
83,"This cannot be, By no assay of reason. 'Tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze. When we consider Th' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, And let ourselves again but understand So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks th' abilities That Rhodes is dressed in. If we make thought of this To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless.","They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true. It’s a trick to confuse us. Think about how important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they could capture Cyprus more easily, since it isn’t as well protected as Rhodes is. If we keep these things in mind, we can’t possibly imagine that the Turks would be so incompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first, setting aside something easy and profitable to do something dangerous and pointless."
84,"Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.","No, I think we can be confident that the Turks aren’t really headed for Rhodes."
85,"The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.","Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with another fleet."
86,"Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?","That’s just what I thought. How many, can you guess?"
87,"Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus,","Thirty ships. Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus. Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him."
88,"'Tis certain then for Cyprus. Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?",Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus. Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
89,He’s now in Florence.,"No, he’s in Florence."
90,"Write from us to him. Post-post-haste, dispatch.",Write to him immediately. Hurry.

We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.","Brave Othello, I have to send you right away to fight the Turks, our great enemy.—(to BRABANTIO) Oh, I didn’t see you there. Welcome, sir. I could have used your wisdom and help tonight."
93,"So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me. Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care Take hold on me, for my particular grief Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows","I could have used yours as well. Forgive me, your grace. I didn’t get out of bed and come here in the dead of night because I heard about the war or because I was worried about the city’s defense. I have a personal problem so painful and gut-wrenching that it overwhelms everything else."
94,"Why, what’s the matter?","Why, what’s the matter?"
95,"My daughter! Oh, my daughter!","It’s my daughter! Oh, my daughter!"
96,Dead?,Is she dead?
97,"Ay, to me. She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks.","She’s dead to me. She’s been tricked and stolen from me, enchanted by black magic spells. She must’ve"

99,"Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.","Whoever tricked your daughter and stole her from you will pay for it. And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son."
100,"Humbly I thank your grace. Here is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems, Hath hither brought.","I humbly thank you, sir. Here is the man, the Moor. It seems you had your own reasons for summoning him here."
101,We are very sorry for’t.,We’re sorry to hear this.
102,"(to OTHELLO)What, in your own part, can you say to this?",(to OTHELLO) What do you have to say for yourself?
103,"Nothing, but this is so.","Nothing, but this is true."
104,"Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, That I have ta'en away this old man’s daughter, It is most true. True, I have married her. The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak,","Noble, honorable gentlemen whom I serve: it’s true that I’ve taken this man’s daughter from him and married her. But that’s my only offense. There’s nothing more. I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker. From the time I was seven years old until nine months ago I’ve been fighting in battles. I don’t know much about the world"
105,"And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnished tale deliver Of my whole course of love. What drugs, what charms, For such proceeding I am charged withal— I won his daughter.","apart from fighting. So I won’t do myself much good by speaking in my own defense. But if you’ll let me, I’ll tell you the plain story of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, and powerful magic—because that’s what I’m being accused of—I used to win his daughter."
106,"A maiden never bold, Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature, To fall in love with what she feared to look on? It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err. Against all rules of nature, and must be driven Why this should be. I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram, conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.","She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient. She blushes at the slightest thing. And you want me to believe that despite her young age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man she’d be afraid to look at? The very thought of it is ridiculous. You’d have to be stupid to think that someone so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that. The devil must be behind this. Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her."
107,"To vouch this is no proof, Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him.","Your saying this isn’t proof. There has to be clear evidence that he’s done this, not just these accusations."
108,"But, Othello, speak. Did you by indirect and forcèd courses Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?","Tell us, Othello. Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way? Or did you agree to this as equals?"
109,"I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary,","Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn"
110,"And let her speak of me before her father. The trust, the office I do hold of you, Not only take away, but let your sentence Even fall upon my life.","and ask her to speak about me in front of her father. If she has anything bad to say about me, then you can sentence me to death."
111,Fetch Desdemona hither.,Bring Desdemona here.
112,"Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.","Iago, bring Desdemona here. You know where she is."
113,I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love And she in mine.,"In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me."
114,"Say it, Othello.","Tell us, Othello."
115,"Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days, Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field, Of hair-breadth ’scapes i' th' imminent deadly breach, Of being taken by the insolent foe And portance in my traveler’s history. Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks, hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak—such was my process—","Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought. I told him everything, from my boyhood up until the time when I was talking to him. I told him about unfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land, and near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures I’ve been through. I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how I bought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts. I was able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other,"
116,"The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline. But still the house affairs would draw her hence, She’d come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse, which I, observing, Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively. I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke She gave me for my pains a world of sighs. She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange, 'Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful. She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake. She loved me for the dangers I had passed, This only is the witchcraft I have used. Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.","and men with heads growing below their shoulders. When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively. If she had to go do some household chore, I noticed that she’d always come back quickly to hear more of my stories. When I was relaxing, she’d pull me aside and ask to hear some part of a story she had missed. Her eyes would fill with tears at the bad things I went through in my younger years. When my stories were done, she’d sigh and tell me how strangely wonderful and sad my life had been. She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her. She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him. I took the hint and spoke to her. She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me. That’s the only witchcraft I ever used. Here comes my wife now. She’ll confirm everything."
117,I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio. Take up this mangled matter at the best. Than their bare hands.,"I think a story like that would win my own daughter over. Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this. Try to accept what’s happened."
118,"I pray you, hear her speak. If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress. Where most you owe obedience?","Please let her speak. If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child. Who do you obey here?"
119,"My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty. To you I am bound for life and education. My life and education both do learn me I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my husband. And so much duty as my mother showed To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess","Father, this isn’t easy for me. I’m torn. I owe you respect because you gave me life and education. You’re the one I have to obey. I’m your daughter. But this man here is my husband now, and I owe him as much as my mother owed you, just as she preferred you to her own father. So I have to give my obedience to the Moor, my husband."
120,"God be with you. I have done. Please it your grace, on to the state affairs. I had rather to adopt a child than get it.— Come hither, Moor. I here do give thee that with all my heart I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child. For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.","I’m finished, then. Duke, please go ahead with your state business. I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor. I’m forced to give my blessing to this marriage. With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you. Desdemona, I’m glad you’re my only child, since if I had others I’d keep them all locked up. You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord."
121,"Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers. When remedies are past, the griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.","Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it. When you lament something bad that’s already happened, you’re setting yourself up for more"
122,"To mourn a mischief that is past and gone What cannot be preserved when fortune takes, Patience her injury a mock'ry makes. The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief, He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.","bad news. A robbery victim who can smile about his losses is superior to the thief who robbed him, but if he cries he’s just wasting time."
123,"We lose it not, so long as we can smile. He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears. But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow These sentences to sugar or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal. But words are words. I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was piercèd through the ears.","So if the Turks steal Cyprus from us, it won’t be bad as long as we keep smiling. It’s easy to accept platitudes like that if you haven’t lost anything. But I’ve lost something precious, and I have to put up with the platitude as well as suffering my loss. Talk is cheap. I’ve never heard of someone feeling better because of someone else’s words. Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs."
124,"The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you, and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist'rous expedition.","The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet. Othello, you understand better than anyone how the defenses for Cyprus work. Even though we have a very good officer in charge there already, everyone says you’re the better man for the job. So I’ll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriage celebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition."
125,"The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize I find in hardness, and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites. Most humbly therefore bending to your state,","I’ve gotten used to the hardships of a military life. I rise to the occasion when faced with difficulties. I will take charge of this war against the Turks. But I humbly ask you to make appropriate arrangements for my wife,"
126,I crave fit disposition for my wife. With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding.,giving her a place to live and people to keep her company that suit her high rank.
127,"Why, at her father’s.",She can stay at her father’s house.
128,I’ll not have it so.,I won’t allow it.
129,"Nor would I there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear T' assist my simpleness.","And I wouldn’t stay there. I don’t want to upset my father by being in his house. Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say."
130,"What would you, Desdemona?","What do you want to do, Desdemona?"
131,"That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes Even to the very quality of my lord. I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. A moth of peace and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence. Let me go with him.","When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him. You can see how much I wanted to be with him by how violently I threw away my old life. I feel like I’m a part of him now, and that means I’m part of a soldier. I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind. I gave my whole life to him because of his honor and bravery. If I were left at home uselessly while he went off to war, then I’m separated from my husband in his natural element. I’d be miserable without him. Let me go with him."
132,"Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite,","Please allow her to do this. I’m not asking to have her near me for sex—I’m too old for that, and my sexual"
133,"Nor to comply with heat the young affects In my defunct and proper satisfaction, And heaven defend your good souls, that you think I will your serious and great business scant When she is with me. No, when light-winged toys Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness That my disports corrupt and taint my business, Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation.","urges are dead. I want this because she wants it—I love her for her mind. And I’d never want you to think that I’d neglect my serious official duties while she was there with me. If I ever let love blind me so that I choose to lounge around in bed with my loved one instead of going off to war, then you can let a housewife use my helmet as a frying pan. My reputation would be disgraced if I ever acted like that."
134,Either for her stay or going. Th' affair cries haste And speed must answer it.,You can decide that privately. I don’t care whether she stays or goes. What’s important is the urgency of this mission. You’ve got to act fast.
135,You must away tonight.,You’ll have to leave tonight.
136,With all my heart.,"With all my heart, I’ll go right away."
137,"At nine i' th' morning here we’ll meet again. And he shall our commission bring to you, And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you.","We’ll meet again at nine in the morning. Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you."
138,"So please your grace, my ancient. A man he is of honesty and trust. With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me.","My lord, my ensign is an honest and trustworthy man. He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need."
139,"Let it be so. Good night to every one.—(to BRABANTIO) And, noble signior, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.","All right, then. Good night, everyone.—(to BRABANTIO) Sir, if goodness is beautiful, your son-in-law is beautiful, not black."
140,"Adieu, brave Moor. Use Desdemona well.","Goodbye, black Moor. Treat Desdemona well."
141,"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father, and may thee.","Keep an eye on her, Moor. She lied to me, and she may lie to you."
142,"My Desdemona must I leave to thee. I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage. Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour To spend with thee. We must obey the time.","I’d bet my life she’d never lie to me. Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you. Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can. Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do. We’re on a tight schedule."
143,Iago.,Iago.
144,"What say’st thou, noble heart?","What do you have to say, noble friend?"
145,"What will I do, think’st thou?",What do you think I should do?
146,I will incontinently drown myself.,I’m going to go drown myself.
147,"If thou dost I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!","If you do that, I’ll never respect you again. Why, you silly man!"
148,"It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.",It’s silly to live when life is torture. The only cure is death.
149,"Oh, villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.","Oh, how stupid! I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him. I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have."
150,"Virtue? A fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts. Whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.","Can’t help it? Nonsense! What we are is up to us. Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener. Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive. If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over. We’d end up in ridiculous situations. Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts. In my opinion, what you call love is just an offshoot of lust."
151,It cannot be.,I don’t believe it.
152,"It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies! I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.","You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower. Come on, be a man. Drown yourself? Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself! I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you."
153,"I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse. Follow thou the wars, defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her. Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! 'Tis clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.","I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now. Here’s what you’ll do. Sell all your assets and your land, and turn it into cash. Desdemona can’t continue loving the Moor any more than he can continue loving her. She fell in love with him very suddenly, and they’ll break up just as suddenly. Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash. What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter. She’ll dump Othello for a younger man. When she’s had enough of the Moor’s body, she’ll realize her mistake. She’ll need to have a new lover. She’ll have to have it. So have your money ready. If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself. Raise all the money you can. I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl. You’ll get to sleep with her—just put together some money. And to hell with drowning yourself! That’s completely beside the point. If you’re ready to die, you can risk death by committing crimes in an attempt to get the woman you want. Don’t just give up on her and drown yourself."
154,"Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted. Thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.","You can trust me. Go now and get cash. I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor. I’m devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted as you are to yours. So let’s join forces and get revenge. If you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, it’ll be fun for both of us. Many things may happen. Go get money. We’ll speak again tomorrow. Goodbye."
155,Where shall we meet i' th' morning?,Where will we meet in the morning?
156,At my lodging.,At my house.
157,I’ll be with thee betimes.,I’ll be there early.
158,"Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?","Go home. Goodbye. Oh, and one more thing—"
159,"No more of drowning, do you hear?","No more talk about killing yourself, okay?"
160,I am changed.,I’ve changed my mind about that.
161,"Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your purse.","Go then, goodbye. Put a lot of cash together."
162,I’ll sell all my land.,I’m going to sell all my land.
163,"For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well. The better shall my purpose work on him. Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now,","That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools. I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him. I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife. I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me. He thinks highly of me. That’ll help. Cassio’s a handsome man. Let’s see, how can I"
164,"In double knavery. How? How? Let’s see. After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear That he is too familiar with his wife. He hath a person and a smooth dispose The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, And will as tenderly be led by th' nose As asses are. Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.","get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time? How? How? Let’s see. After a while I’ll start telling Othello that Cassio is too intimate with Desdemona. Cassio is a smooth talker and a good-looking guy, the sort of man that people would expect to be a seducer. The Moor is open and straightforward. He thinks any man who seems honest is honest. People like that are easy to manipulate. So it’s all decided. I’ve worked it out. With a little help from the devil, I’ll bring this monstrous plan to success."
165,What from the cape can you discern at sea?,What can you see out on the ocean?
166,Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood. I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail.,"Nothing. The water’s so rough that I can’t see any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean."
167,"A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements. If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?",It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook our fortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together in those mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result of this storm?
168,"For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds, The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood.",The Turkish navy will be broken up. The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky. I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
169,"If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.","If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this storm."
170,"News, lads, Our wars are done! The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks, That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance","I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over! This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked."
171,How? Is this true?,What? Is this true?
172,"The ship is here put in, A Veronesa. Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore. The Moor himself at sea","The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s from Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. He’s been commissioned to come here to Cyprus."
173,I am glad on ’t. 'Tis a worthy governor.,I’m happy about that. He’ll be a good governor.
174,"But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe. For they were parted","Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but he’s worried about the Othello’s safety. The two of them were separated during the storm."
175,"Pray heavens he be, For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho! As well to see the vessel that’s come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, An indistinct regard.","I hope to God Othello’s all right. I served under him, and I know what an excellent commander he is. Let’s go to the shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out for Othello’s ship. We’ll stare out at the sea until the sea and the sky blur together."
176,"Come, let’s do so. For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.",Let’s do that. Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
177,"Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.","Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello. I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea."
178,Is he well shipped?,Is his ship sturdy?
179,"His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure.","Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have some hope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too high."
180,"(within) A sail, a sail, a sail!",(offstage) A sail! A sail! A sail!
181,What noise?,What’s all that shouting about?
182,"Stand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”",Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A sail!”
183,My hopes do shape him for the governor.,I hope it’s Othello.
184,They do discharge their shot of courtesy. Our friends at least.,"They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least it’s a friendly ship."
185,And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.,Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
186,I shall.,I’ll do that.
187,"But good lieutenant, is your general wived?","Good lieutenant, is your general married?"
188,"Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maid One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, And in th' essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener.","Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he did. His wife defies description. She’s God’s masterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her justice while praising her."
189,How now? Who has put in?,Who’s arrived in the harbor?
190,"He’s had most favorable and happy speed. Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The guttered rocks and congregated sands, Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel, Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona.","He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and the sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman. They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound."
191,What is she?,Who’s that?
192,"She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain, Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort!","She’s the one I was talking about, the general’s wife. The brave Iago was put in charge of bringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we expected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here safely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms, and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus."
193,"Oh, behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore! You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees. Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round!","Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore. We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus! Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you."
194,"I thank you, valiant Cassio. What tidings can you tell me of my lord?","Thank you, brave Cassio. Is there any news about my husband?"
195,But that he’s well and will be shortly here.,"He hasn’t arrived yet. As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon."
196,"Oh, but I fear. How lost you company?","Oh, but I’m worried. How did you two get separated?"
197,The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship—,The storm separated us.
198,"But, hark! a sail.","Listen, they’ve spotted another ship!"
199,They give this greeting to the citadel. This likewise is a friend.,"They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship."
200,See for the news.,Go find out the news.
201,"Good ancient, you are welcome.—Welcome, mistress. Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, That I extend my manners. 'Tis my breeding That gives me this bold show of courtesy.","Ensign Iago, welcome.—And welcome to you, too, madam. (he kisses EMILIA) Don’t be upset that I kissed your wife hello, Iago. It’s a courtesy where I come from."
202,"Sir, would she give you so much of her lips You’ll have enough.","If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now."
203,"Alas, she has no speech!","On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman."
204,"In faith, too much. I find it still, when I have leave to sleep. She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.","No, she talks too much. She’s always talking when I want to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet. But she’s scolding me silently."
205,You have little cause to say so.,You have no reason to say that.
206,"Come on, come on. You are pictures out of door, bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.","Come on, come on. You women are all the same. You’re as pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells. In your own kitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound like saints when you’re complaining about something, but you act like devils when someone offends you. You don’t take your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless hussies in bed."
207,"Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!","Shame on you, you slanderer!"
208,You rise to play and go to bed to work.,"No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed."
209,You shall not write my praise.,You clearly have nothing good to say about me.
210,"No, let me not.","No, I don’t."
211,"What wouldst thou write of me, if thou should’st praise me?","But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?"
212,"O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,","Don’t make me do it, my lady. I’m critical by nature."
213,"Come on, assay. There’s one gone to the harbor?","Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to the harbor?"
214,"Ay, madam.","Yes, madam."
215,"I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.","I’m not as happy as I seem. I’m just trying not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety. Come on, what would you say about me?"
216,"I am about it, but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze, It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors And thus she is delivered: The one’s for use, the other useth it.","I’m trying to think of something, but I’m not good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah, I’ve got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her good looks to get what she wants."
217,Well praised! How if she be black and witty?,Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly?
218,"If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.","Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her."
219,How if fair and foolish?,What if she’s pretty but stupid?
220,"She never yet was foolish that was fair, For even her folly helped her to an heir.","No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men."
221,These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' th' alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her That’s foul and foolish?,These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. What horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s both ugly and stupid?
222,But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.,"No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do."
223,"Oh, heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?","You don’t know a thing! You give your best praise to the worst women. But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?"
224,"She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were—","A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would—"
225,To do what?,Would do what?
226,"Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?","Oh, that’s pathetic! Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband. What do you think about him, Cassio? Isn’t he a horrible man?"
227,"He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.","He speaks bluntly, madam. He’s more of a soldier than a wise man."
228,"(aside) He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper! With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do, I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, 'Tis so, indeed.","(to himself) He’s taking her hand. That’s right, go ahead and whisper together. This is all I need to get Cassio. Yes, keep smiling at her, Cassio. Your fine manners around women will be your downfall. Oh, I’m sure you’re saying something very clever."
229,"If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good, well kissed, and excellent courtesy! ’tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!—","If you lose your job because of little flirtations like this, you’ll wish you hadn’t been so courteous with her. Oh, how nice, you’re 

kissing
A gentleman’s kissing his own fingers was considered a polite gesture.

kissing your own hand, one finger at a time? I wish those fingers were enema tubes!—"
230,'Tis truly so.,"Yes, it is."
231,Let’s meet him and receive him.,Let’s go greet him when he lands.
232,"Lo, where he comes!","Look, here he comes."
233,Oh my fair warrior!,My beautiful warrior!
234,My dear Othello!,My darling Othello!
235,"It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me. Oh, my soul’s joy! May the winds blow till they have wakened death, And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus-high, and duck again as low As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die, My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.","I’m amazed you got here before me. But I’m overjoyed! My love, if the calm after the storm could always be this wonderful, I’d want the wind to blow until it waked the dead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains! If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life."
236,"The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase,","God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older."
237,"Amen to that, sweet powers! I cannot speak enough of this content. It stops me here, it is too much of joy. And this, and this, the greatest discords be (kissing her) That e'er our hearts shall make!",Amen to that! I can’t talk about my happiness anymore. It’s too much. I hope these kisses I’m about to give you are the closest we ever come to fighting. (they kiss)
238,"Oh, you are well tuned now, But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am.","(to himself) Oh, you’re happy now, but I’ll ruin your happiness, for all my supposed honesty."
239,"Come, let us to the castle. News, friends! Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned. How does my old acquaintance of this isle?— I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote In mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago, Go to the bay and disembark my coffers. He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona, Once more, well met at Cyprus.","Let’s go up to the castle. Good news, friends. The war’s over and the Turks are drowned. How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus. They’ve been very good to me here. Oh, my dear, I’m blabbing on and on because I’m so happy.—Iago, would you be good enough to go get my trunks from the ships? And bring the ship’s captain to the castle. He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona. I’ll say it again: I’m so happy to see you here in Cyprus!"
240,"Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—Come hither. If thou be’st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.","Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here. They say love makes cowards brave. So if you’re brave, listen to me. Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight. But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him."
241,"Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners and beauties. All which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions that has an eye, can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself. A devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.","Be quiet and listen to me. Remember how she fell madly in love with the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories? Did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering? You’re too smart to think that. No, she needs someone nice-looking. Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she find in him? Lovemaking gets boring after a while. To keep things hot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her. Othello isn’t any of those things. Since he doesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to her, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke. She’ll start looking around for a second choice. Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio? He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust. Nobody’s as crafty as he is. Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for. He’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on him already."
242,I cannot believe that in her. She’s full of most blessed condition.,I can’t believe that. She’s not that kind of woman. She’s very moral.
243,"Blessed fig’s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?","Like hell she is! She’s made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else. If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place. Good lord! Did you notice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s hands? Did you see that?"
244,"Yes, that I did, but that was but courtesy.","Yes, I did. But that wasn’t romantic, it was just polite manners."
245,Well.,All right.
246,"Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may. For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.","He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff. Try to get him to do that. That’ll allow me to stir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus. I’ll get them so riled up that they’ll only calm down when Cassio’s fired. To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way. If you don’t do that, things are hopeless for you."
247,"I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.","I’ll do it, if you help me out."
248,I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.,I promise I will. Meet me in a little while at the citadel. I need to get Othello’s things from the ship. Goodbye.
249,"That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t. That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit. The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too, Not out of absolute lust—though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin— But partly led to diet my revenge, Hath leaped into my seat. The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife. At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, Abuse him to the Moor in the right garb (For I fear Cassio with my night-cape too) Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me For making him egregiously an ass Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused. Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.","I think Cassio really does love her, and it’s perfectly likely that she loves him too. I can’t stand the Moor, but I have to admit that he’s a reliable, loving, and good-natured man. He’d probably be a good husband to Desdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed my revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. That thought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight. If that piece of Venetian trash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan, I’ll have power over Cassio. I’ll say bad things about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced my wife as well. I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time. I’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked out the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan until the moment comes."
250,"It is Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant

255,"Not this hour, lieutenant, ’tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.","Not yet, lieutenant. It’s not even ten o'clock. The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him. He hasn’t spent the night with her yet, and she’s beautiful enough to be 

Jove’s

Jove’s lover."
256,"And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.",And I bet she’s good in bed too.
257,Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.,"Yes, she’s young and tender."
258,What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.,And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation.
259,"An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.","Yes, she’s pretty. But she’s modest and ladylike too."
260,She is indeed perfection.,"She’s a perfect woman, it’s true."
261,"Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.","Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant. I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen want to drink a toast to the black Othello."
262,"Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.","Not tonight, Iago. I’m not much of a drinker. I wish there was less social pressure to drink."
263,"Oh, they are our friends. But one cup. I’ll drink for you.","Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. I’ll do most of the drinking for you."
264,"What, man, ’tis a night of revels! The gallants desire it.","What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! The gentlemen are waiting."
265,Where are they?,Where are they?
266,Here at the door. I pray you call them in.,By the door. Please invite them in.
267,"I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.","I’ll do it, but I don’t like it."
268,"With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out, Potations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch. Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits (That hold their honors in a wary distance, The very elements of this warlike isle) And they watch too. Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle. But here they come. If consequence do but approve my dream","If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twisted up inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the gallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the rest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus who are quick to take offense. Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success."
269,"'Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.","My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink."

272,"I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.","I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking. The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English."
273,Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?,Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
274,"Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain. He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.","They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans. And the Dutch are vomiting while the English are asking for refills."
275,To the health of our general!,Let’s drink to our general!
276,"Oh, sweet England! (sings) King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown, With that he called the tailor lown. He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree, 'Tis pride that pulls the country down, Some wine, ho!","Oh, sweet England! (he sings)  King Stephen was a good king, and his pants were very cheap,  But he thought his tailor overcharged him, so he called him a peasant.  And that was a man of noble rank, much higher than you are.  So be happy with your worn-out cloak,  Since pride is ruining the nation.  More wine!"
277,"Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.","God, that song’s even better than the other one."
278,Will you hear ’t again?,Do you want to hear it again?

Let’s have no more of this, let’s to our affairs.—Forgive us our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk.

285,"You see this fellow that is gone before, He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction. And do but see his vice, The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pity of him. I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island.","You see that man who just left? He’s a good soldier, good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man. But he has a serious weakness. It’s too bad. I’m worried that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for Cyprus eventually."
286,But is he often thus?,But is he often like this?
287,He’ll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle.,He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep. He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
288,"It were well The general were put in mind of it. Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?","The general should be informed about this. Maybe he’s never noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good side. Don’t you think so?"
289,"(aside) How now, Roderigo? I pray you, after the lieutenant, go!","(speaking so that only RODERIGO can hear) Hello, Roderigo. Please, follow the lieutenant. Hurry! Go!"
290,And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor With one of an ingraft infirmity. It were an honest action to say So to the Moor.,And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We should definitely say something to the Moor.
291,"Not I, for this fair island. I do love Cassio well, and would do much","I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole island for doing so. I respect Cassio and I’d like to help cure his alcoholism—"

307,"Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this? Are we turned Turks? And to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light, he dies upon his motion. Silence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?— Speak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.","How did this all start? Have we all become as savage as the Turks, treating each other as badly as they would have treated us? For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!

What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset. Speak up and tell me who started this. Answer me."

You’re famous for it. Wise people respect you. What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler? Tell me."
313,"Your officer Iago can inform you, While I spare speech, which something now offends me, Of all that I do know. Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.","Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt. Your officer Iago can tell you what happened. I should save my breath, since it hurts to talk. I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me."
314,"Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied,","All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool. By God, if you don’t tell me what happened you’ll all suffer. Tell me how this fight began, who started it. Whoever is guilty, even if he were my twin brother, I swear I’m through with him. We’re in a town that’s just"
315,"Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on, And he that is approved in this offence, Shall lose me. What, in a town of war Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel? In night, and on the court and guard of safety?","avoided a war, everyone’s still on edge, and you’re getting into private fights while you’re supposed to be on guard duty? That’s unbelievably bad. Iago, who started it?"
316,If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier.,"I know you’re close to Cassio, but if you diverge from the truth in any way, you’re not a true soldier."
317,"Touch me not so near. I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him. This it is, general: Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause, Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out— Outran my purpose, and I returned then rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight I ne'er might say before. When I came back— At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them. More of this matter cannot I report.","You’re hitting close to home there. I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio. But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth. This is what happened, General. Montano and I were talking when a man came running, crying for help. Cassio was chasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy. This gentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. I followed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring the public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heard the swords clinking and Cassio swearing. I’d never heard him swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart. I can’t tell you anything else."
318,"But men are men, the best sometimes forget. As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass.","But nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass."
319,"I know, Iago, Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee But never more be officer of mine.—","Iago, I know you’re fond of Cassio and are downplaying this for his benefit. Cassio, I love you, but you’re never again going to be one of my officers.—"
320,"Look, if my gentle love be not raised up! I’ll make thee an example.","Look, you’ve woken my wife! I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from."
321,"All’s well, sweeting, Come away to bed.—(to MONTANO) Sir, for your hurts Myself will be your surgeon. Lead him off.","Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart. Go back to bed.— (to MONTANO) I’ll see to it personally that your wounds are treated. Lead him off."
322,"Iago, look with care about the town Come, Desdemona, ’tis the soldiers' life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.","Iago, go and calm down the townspeople.—Come with me, Desdemona. Unfortunately, it’s part of the soldier’s life to be woken up by trouble."
323,"What, are you hurt, lieutenant?","Are you hurt, lieutenant?"
324,"Ay, past all surgery.","Yes, but no doctor can help me."
325,"Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!","My reputation, my reputation! I’ve lost my reputation, the longest-living and truest part of myself! Everything else in me is just animal-like. Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!"
326,"As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound. There is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.","I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically. Your physical health matters more than your reputation. A reputation is a useless and fake quality that others impose on us. You haven’t lost it unless you think you have. There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again. You’ve been discharged because he’s angry, and because he’s obliged to do so for policy reasons, not because he dislikes you. He’s got to beat up the weak to frighten the strong. Go to him, petition him. He’ll change his mind."
327,"I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!","I’d rather ask him to hate me than ask such a good commander to accept such a worthless, drunk, stupid officer as myself. Drunk? Babbling senselessly? Squabbling? Swaggering? Swearing? Ranting and raving to my own shadow! Oh, wine is the devil!"
328,What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?,Who were you chasing with your sword? What did he do to you?
329,Is ’t possible?,Is that possible?
330,"I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly. A quarrel, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!","I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly. I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting. Oh God, why do men drink and lose their minds? Why do we party until we’re like animals?"
331,"Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recovered?",You seem all right now. How did you get better?
332,"It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.","My drunkenness went away when anger took over. One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself."
333,"I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard. Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! Oh, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.","I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk. Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that. I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast! Oh, how strange! Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!"
334,"Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.","Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it. Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore. Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend."
335,"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!","I know that, sir. Imagine, me, a drunk!"
336,"You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.","Any man can get drunk sometime. I’ll tell you what to do. Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now. He’s completely devoted to her. Go open your heart to her. Ask her to help you get back your position. She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do. Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you. I’d bet my lucky stars your problem will be forgotten, and your relationship will be stronger than ever."
337,"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.",I’m helping you because I like and respect you.
338,"I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.",I believe it completely. Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case. My situation is desperate.
339,"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.","You’re doing the right thing. Good night, lieutenant. I’ve got to go to the guard tower."
340,"Good night, honest Iago.","Good night, honest Iago."
341,"When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor, were to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin, His soul is so enfettered to her love, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now. For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,","Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good? That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again. It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side. She’s full of good intentions. And the Moor loves her so much he would renounce his Christianity to keep her happy. He’s so enslaved by love that she can make him do whatever she wants. How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good? That’s the kind of argument you’d expect from Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while she’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll poison the Moor’s ear against her,"
342,That she repeals him for her body’s lust. And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor. So will I turn her virtue into pitch That shall enmesh them all.,"hinting that she’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust for him. The more she tries to help Cassio, the more she’ll shake Othello’s confidence in her. And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all."
343,"How now, Roderigo!","Hello, Roderigo!"
344,"I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains. And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.","I’m totally worn out. My chase is too much for me. I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up. The upshot is that I’ve got a little more experience. So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice."
345,"How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? And wit depends on dilatory time. Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee. And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered Cassio. Though other things grow fair against the sun, Content thyself awhile. In troth, ’tis morning. Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee, go where thou art billeted. Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.","You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient! If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately? No, it heals gradually. We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time. Aren’t things going well? Cassio’s beaten you up, but with that tiny sacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged! If we’re patient, we’ll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors. My God, it’s morning. All this excitement has made the time fly by. Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep. Go on, I’m telling you. You’ll understand better later. Go."
346,"Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress. I’ll set her on. Myself, the while, to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Dull not device by coldness and delay.","Now two things still need to be done. My wife has to help make Desdemona take Cassio’s side. I’ll put her on that. And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment when Cassio’s talking to Desdemona, so he’ll see them together. Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it. Let’s not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to act."
347,"Masters, play here, I will content your pains. Something that’s brief, and bid “Good morrow, general.”","Musicians, start playing here. I’ll pay you for your trouble. Play something short that will put the general in a good mood."
348,"Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' th' nose thus?","Your instruments all have a nasal twang. Have they been to  Naples
Naples was considered a likely place to contract syphilis, which eats away at the bridge of the nose.Naples?"
349,"How, sir? How?",Excuse me?
350,"Ay, marry, are they, sir.","Yes, they are."
351,"Oh, thereby hangs a tail.","Oh, there’s the problem."
352,"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?",What’s the problem?
353,"Marry sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here’s money for you, and the general so likes your music that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.","Anyone full of hot air is a problem. But here’s some money. The general likes your music a lot, but he asks you to stop playing now."
354,"If you have any music that may not be heard, to ’t again. But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.","If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that. But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now."
355,"We have none such, sir.",We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
356,"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away. Go, vanish into air, away!",Then pack up your instruments and go away. Go!
357,"Dost thou hear, my honest friend?","Do you hear, my friend?"
358,"Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring, tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech. Wilt thou do this?","Please don’t play games. (CASSIO gives CLOWN money). There’s a bit of gold for you. When the woman taking care of the general’s wife wakes up, could you please tell her that Cassio asks to speak with her?"
359,"She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.","She’s awake, sir. If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message."
360,"In happy time, Iago.","Good to see you, Iago."
361,"You have not been abed, then?","You didn’t go to sleep, then?"
362,"Why, no. The day had broke Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.","No. When I left you it was already morning. I’ve been bold, Iago. I’ve asked to talk to your wife. I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona."
363,"I’ll send her to you presently, And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor May be more free.","I’ll send her out to you now. I’ll think of a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more openly."
364,I humbly thank you for’t.,I humbly thank you.
365,I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest.,"Even for a  Florentine
The citizens of Florence (who included Machiavelli) were not known for kindness and honesty, but Michael Cassio seems unaware of Florence’s bad reputation.Florentine, I never knew someone so kind and honest."
366,"Good morrow, good Lieutenant. I am sorry The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again.","Good morning, lieutenant. I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right. The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly. The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you. But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back."
367,"Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, With Desdemona alone.","Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right."
368,Pray you come in. I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.,Please come in. I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
369,I am much bound to you.,Thank you very much.
370,"These letters give, Iago, to the pilot, And by him do my duties to the senate. That done, I will be walking on the works, Repair there to me.","Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who
                                brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of

373,"Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.","I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio."
374,"Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his.","Please do, madam. My husband’s so upset about Cassio’s problem you’d think it was his own."
375,But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.,"Your husband’s such a good man. Don’t worry, Cassio. I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before."
376,"Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He’s never anything but your true servant.","My dear beautiful lady, whatever happens to Michael Cassio, he’ll always be your humble servant."
377,"You have known him long, and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a polite distance.",I know that. Thank you. You’re my husband’s friend and you’ve known him a long time. I assure you the only reason he’s keeping away from you now is political.
378,"Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.","Yes, my lady. But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job."
379,"Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it To the last article. My lord shall never rest, I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.","That’ll never happen. Emilia here will be my witness: I promise you that you’ll get your position back again. And if I promise to help someone, I do everything I can. My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out"

386,Ha! I like not that.,Hey! I don’t like that.
387,What dost thou say?,What did you say?
388,Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?,Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
389,"Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it That he would steal away so guilty-like Seeing you coming.","Cassio, my lord? No, I don’t think so. He wouldn’t sneak away looking so guilty when he saw you coming."
390,"How now, my lord? I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.","What’s this, my lord? I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger."
391,Who is ’t you mean?,Who do you mean?
392,"Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, His present reconciliation take. For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face.","Your lieutenant, Cassio. Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him. In my judgment, this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked. Please call him and tell him to come back here."
393,Went he hence now?,Was that him just now?
394,"Ay, sooth, so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.","Yes. He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him. My love, call him back in here."

I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to do To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much—","Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning. Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days. He’s very sorry. His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers. So when should he come? Tell me, Othello. I can’t imagine you asking me for something and me telling you no or standing there muttering. Michael Cassio came with you when you were trying to win my love. Sometimes I’d criticize you to him, and he’d defend you. And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back? I swear, I could do so much—"
402,I will deny thee nothing.,"Please, no more. He can come whenever he wants. I won’t refuse you anything."

Of my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?” And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me","“Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud. You’re thinking something. Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife. What didn’t you like? And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.

And I know you’re full of love and honesty, and you think carefully before you speak. That’s why these pauses of yours frighten me. If some fool were withholding things from me, I wouldn’t think twice about it. If some lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick. But when an honest man acts like that, you know he’s wrestling with bad thoughts and can’t help it."
427,"For Michael Cassio,","As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest."
428,I think so too.,I think so too.
429,"Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none!","People should be what they appear to be. If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!"
430,"Certain, men should be what they seem.","Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be."
431,Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.,"In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man."
432,"I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.","No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on. Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions."
433,"Good my lord, pardon me, Though I am bound to every act of duty Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false, As where’s that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure Wherein uncleanly apprehensions With meditations lawful?","Please don’t make me do that, sir. I have to obey all your orders, but surely I’m not obligated to reveal my deepest thoughts—even slaves aren’t expected to do that. You want me to say what I’m thinking? What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong? Even good people think horrible things sometimes. Who is so pure that they never think a bad thought?"
434,"Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.","You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even think your friend has been wronged and you don’t tell him about it."
435,"I do beseech you, As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not, that your wisdom, From one that so imperfectly conceits, Out of his scattering and unsure observance. It were not for your quiet nor your good,","Please don’t ask me to tell you. I might be completely wrong. I have a bad tendency to be suspicious of people and to look too closely into what they’re doing. Often I imagine crimes that aren’t really there. You would be wise to ignore my weak guesses and imaginary suspicions, and don’t worry yourself about the meaningless things I’ve noticed. For me to tell you my thoughts would only destroy your peace of mind, and"
436,"Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom To let you know my thoughts.","it wouldn’t be wise, honest, or responsible for me to tell them."
437,What dost thou mean?,What are you talking about?
438,"Is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse steals trash. 'Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches from me my good name And makes me poor indeed.","A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike. If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash. It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more. But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer."
439,I’ll know thy thoughts.,I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
440,"You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.","You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you. And as long my heart’s inside my body, you never will."
441,Ha!,What?
442,"It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger, But, oh, what damnèd minutes tells he o'er","Beware of jealousy, my lord! It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours. The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isn’t friends with the man she’s sleeping with. But think of the unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness. He suspects her, but still loves her."
443,"Oh, misery!","Oh, what misery!"
444,"Poor and content is rich, and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor. From jealousy!","The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough. But infinite riches are nothing to someone who’s always afraid he’ll be poor. God, help us not be jealous!"
445,"Why, why is this? Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blowed surmises, Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt, For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago, And on the proof there is no more but this: Away at once with love or jealousy!","Why are you telling me this? Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour? No. If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt. I might as well be a goat if I ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions you’re implying. If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous. When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better. And I’m not going to start feeling inferior. She had her eyes wide open when she chose me. No, Iago, I’ll have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, I’ll look for proof, and if there’s proof, that’s when I’ll let go of my love and my jealousy."
446,"I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio. Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure. I would not have your free and noble nature I know our country disposition well. In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep’t unknown.","I’m glad to hear you say that. Now I can show you my devotion and my duty with more honesty. So please listen to me. I’m not talking about proof yet. Watch your wife. Watch how she is with Cassio. Just watch—don’t be either completely suspicious or completely trustful. I wouldn’t want to see you taken advantage of because you’re such an open and trusting guy. Watch out! I know the people of Venice well. They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands. They don’t avoid doing things that are wrong, they just try not to get caught."
447,"She did deceive her father, marrying you, And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most.","She lied to her father to marry you. And when she pretended to be afraid of you, she loved you the most."
448,And so she did.,"That’s right, she did."
449,"Why, go to then. She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, He thought ’twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame. I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you.","Well, there you go. She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft! But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out. I beg your pardon for loving you too much."
450,I am bound to thee forever.,I’m indebted to you forever.
451,I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.,You seem a little depressed about this.
452,"Trust me, I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved. I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach","Really, I’m afraid you are. I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you. But I see you’re troubled. Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken."
453,I will not.,I won’t.
454,"Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend—","If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have. Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset."
455,"No, not much moved. I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.","No, not too upset. I’m sure Desdemona would never cheat on me."
456,Long live she so. And long live you to think so.,I hope she never does! And I hope you keep on thinking she wouldn’t.
457,"And yet how nature, erring from itself—","But still, it’s true that good things can go bad, away from their true natures—"
458,"Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you, Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, Whereto we see in all things nature tends— Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank, Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural. Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forms, And happily repent.","That’s the point I’m trying to make. If I can be frank with you, she veered away from her own nature in turning down all those young men from her own country, with her skin color, with her status—everything her nature would have drawn her to—Ugh! You can almost smell the dark and ugly desires inside her, the unnatural thoughts—But—I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to refer to her specifically just now. I only worry that she might snap back to her natural taste in men one day, and compare you unfavorably to other Italians."
459,"Farewell, farewell. Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.","Goodbye, goodbye. If you see anything else, let me know. Tell your wife to watch her. Leave me alone now, Iago."
460,"My lord, I take my leave. (going)","My lord, I’ll say goodbye now. (beginning to exit)"
461,"(aside) Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.","(to himself) Why did I ever get married? I’m sure this good and honest man sees and knows more, much more, than he’s telling me."
462,"To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time. Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place, For sure, he fills it up with great ability, Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, Note if your lady strain his entertainment","(returning) My lord, please don’t think about this any more. Time will tell. It’s right for Cassio to have his lieutenancy back—he’s very talented. But keep him away for a while, and you’ll see how he goes about getting it back. Notice whether your wife insists on your"

That will tell you a lot. But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please."
464,Fear not my government.,Don’t worry about how I handle it.
465,I once more take my leave.,I’ll say goodbye once more.
466,"This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities, with a learnèd spirit, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much— She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief Must be to loathe her. Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses. Yet ’tis the plague to great ones, Prerogatived are they less than the base. Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken. Look where she comes.","This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior. If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart. Maybe because I’m black, and I don’t have nice manners like courtiers do, or because I’m getting old—but that’s not much—She’s gone, and I’ve been cheated on. I have no choice but to hate her. Oh what a curse marriage is! We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their desires are free! I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others. This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men. It’s our destiny, like death. We are destined to be betrayed when we are born. Oh, here she comes."

522,"Nay, yet be wise, yet we see nothing done, She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief","No, be reasonable. We don’t have any proof yet. She might still be faithful. Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?"
523,"I gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.","Yes, I gave her one like that. It was my first gift to her."
524,"I know not that, but such a handkerchief— I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with.","I don’t know about that, but I saw a handkerchief like that today. I’m sure it belongs to your wife, and I saw Cassio use it to wipe his beard."
525,If it be that—,If it’s the same one—

540,"He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing.","He’s a soldier. If I accused a soldier of lying, he’d stab me."
541,To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.,Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
542,Can anything be made of this?,What on earth does that mean?
543,"I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.","I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying."
544,Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?,Can you ask around and find out?
545,"Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.","Find him and tell him to come here. Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right."
546,"To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.",I think I can do that. It’s not too much to ask.
547,"Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?","Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?"
548,"I know not, madam.","I don’t know, madam."
549,"Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.","Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins. This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy."
550,"Who, he? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.","Who, him? I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land."
551,Look where he comes.,"Look, here he comes."
552,I will not leave him now till Cassio,"I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?"
553,"Well, my good lady.—(aside) Oh, hardness to dissemble!— How do you, Desdemona?","I’m fine, my lady.—(to himself) Oh, it’s so hard to pretend!—How are you, Desdemona?"
554,"Well, my good lord.","I’m fine, my lord."
555,"Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.","Give me your  hand
Moist hands were supposed to indicate a tendency toward love.hand. Your hand’s moist, my lady."
556,It hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.,It’s moist because it’s still young and inexperienced.
557,"Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,","It says you’re fertile, and you’ve got a giving heart. Hot, hot and moist. With a hand like this you need to"
558,"Much castigation, exercise devout, For here’s a young and sweating devil here, A frank one.","fast and pray to stave off temptations. Someone with a young sweating hand like this one is bound to act up sooner or later. It’s a nice hand, an open one."
559,"You may indeed say so, For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.",You’re right to say that. This was the hand that gave you my heart.
560,"A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.","This hand gives itself away very freely. In the old days, people used to give their hearts to each other when they joined their hands in marriage. But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts."
561,"What promise, chuck?","What did I promise, my dear?"
562,I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.,I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
563,I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me. Lend me thy handkerchief.,I have a bad cold that’s bothering me. Lend me your handkerchief.
564,"Here, my lord.","Here, my lord."
565,I have it not about me.,I don’t have it with me.
566,Not?,You don’t?
567,"No, indeed, my lord.","No, my lord."
568,"That’s a fault. That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give, She was a charmer and could almost read","That’s not good. An Egyptian woman gave that handkerchief to my mother. She was a witch, and she could"
569,"The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made gift of it, my father’s eye Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me To give it her. I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye. To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition As nothing else could match.","almost read people’s thoughts. She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her. But if she lost it or gave it away, my father would start hating her and looking at other women. When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married. I did. So pay attention. Treat it as something precious. Losing it or giving it away would be an unspeakable loss, a loss like none other."
570,Is ’t possible?,Is that possible?
571,"A sibyl, that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sewed the work. The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, Conserved of maidens' hearts.","Yes, it’s true. There’s magic in its fabric. A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance. The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts."
572,Indeed? Is ’t true?,Really? Is that true?
573,"Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.","It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it."
574,Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!,I wish I had never seen it!
575,Ha! Wherefore?,Ha! Why?
576,"Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o' th' way?","Is it lost? Is it gone? Tell me, is it missing?"
577,Bless us!,God help me!
578,Say you?,What do you have to say for yourself?
579,"It is not lost, but what and if it were?","It’s not lost, but what if it were?"
580,"I say, it is not lost.","I’m telling you, it’s not lost."
581,"Fetch ’t, let me see ’t.",Then bring it here. Let me see it.
582,"Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. This is a trick to put me from my suit. Pray you, let Cassio be received again.","I could, sir. But I don’t want to now. This is just a trick to take my mind off what I’m asking you for. Please hire Cassio again."
583,"Come, come, You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.",Come on. You know you’ll never find a more capable man.
584,The handkerchief!,The handkerchief!
585,"A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,",He’s counted on your friendship for his success. He’s shared dangers with you—
586,The handkerchief!,The handkerchief!
587,"In sooth, you are to blame.","Really, I don’t think you’re behaving very well."
588,Away!,Damn it!
589,Is not this man jealous?,And you say he’s not jealous?
590,I ne'er saw this before. I am most unhappy in the loss of it.,I never saw him like this before. There must be some magic in that handkerchief. I’m miserable that I lost it.
591,"'Tis not a year or two shows us a man. They are all but stomachs, and we all but food. To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,","Men are all the same, but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are. They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food. They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up. Look, here comes Cassio and my husband."
592,"There is no other way. 'Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.","There’s no other way. She’s the one who’s got to do it. And what luck, she’s here! Go ahead and ask her."
593,"How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?","Hello, Cassio. How are you?"
594,"Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you Exist, and be a member of his love Whom I, with all the office of my heart Entirely honor. I would not be delayed. If my offence be of such mortal kind Nor purposed merit in futurity, Can ransom me into his love again, But to know so must be my benefit. So shall I clothe me in a forced content, To fortune’s alms.","Nothing, madam. Just my earlier request. I’m begging you to help me get back on his good side. I’m devoted to him with all my heart. I can’t wait any longer. If my wrongdoing was so serious that I can’t get back into his good graces either by my past service, or my present situation, or the promise of devoted service in the future, just knowing that would help me. Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career."
595,"Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio, My advocation is not now in tune. My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered. As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech. You must awhile be patient. What I can do I will, and more I will","I’m sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time to bring up your case. My husband’s not himself. If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him. God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive. You’ll just have to be patient for a little while. I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself. Let that be enough for you."
596,Is my lord angry?,Is Othello angry?
597,"He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness.","He just left, clearly upset about something."
598,"Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air Puffed his own brother—and is he angry? Something of moment then, I will go meet him. There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry.","Can he even get angry? It’s hard to believe. I’ve seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting an eyelid—is he really upset? It must be about something important. I’ll go talk to him. If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong."
599,"I prithee, do so.","Please, do so."
600,"Something, sure, of state, Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so, Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, Arraigning his unkindness with my soul, But now I find I had suborned the witness, And he’s indicted falsely.","There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood. Men always get angry about little things when they’re really worried about bigger ones. That’s the way it goes. When our finger hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too. We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday. Oh, Emilia, I’m so inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was judging him harshly."
601,"Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception","I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you."
602,Alas the day! I never gave him cause.,Oh no! I never gave him reason to be jealous.
603,"But jealous souls will not be answered so. They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster","But jealous people don’t think like that. They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous. It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing."
604,Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!,I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
605,"Lady, amen.","Amen to that, lady."
606,"I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout. If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit","I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here. If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can."
607,I humbly thank your ladyship.,"I thank you, lady."
608,"Save you, friend Cassio!","Hello, Cassio!"
609,"What make you from home? How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca? Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.","Why are you so far from home? How are you, my pretty Bianca? To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house."
610,"What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights? Eight score eight hours? And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times! Oh weary reckoning!",And I was just going to yours. You’ve kept away from me for a week? Seven days and seven nights? A hundred and sixty-eight hours? And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones! What a tedious wait!
611,"Pardon me, Bianca, But I shall, in a more continuate time, Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca, (giving her DESDEMONA’s handkerchief) Take me this work out.","I’m sorry, Bianca. All this time I’ve been depressed and had problems on my mind. When I get some free time I’ll make it up to you. (he gives her DESDEMONA ’s handkerchief) Sweet Bianca, would you copy this embroidery pattern for me?"
612,"O Cassio, whence came this? To the felt absence now I feel a cause. Is ’t come to this? Well, well.","Oh, Cassio, where did you get this? This is a gift from another woman, a new lover! Now I know why you’ve been staying away from me. Has it come to this? Well, well."
613,"Go to, woman, Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth From whence you have them. You are jealous now No, in good troth, Bianca.","Oh, come on, woman. Stop jumping to silly conclusions. Now you’re jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress of mine, but I swear it’s not, Bianca."
614,"Why, whose is it?","Well, whose is it?"
615,"I know not neither, I found it in my chamber. I like the work well. Ere it be demanded, As like enough it will, I would have it copied.","I don’t even know. I found it in my room. It’s pretty. Someone is certainly looking for it, and I’ll have to give it back. So I’d like it copied. Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while."
616,Leave you! Wherefore?,Leave you alone! Why?
617,"I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.","I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman."
618,"Why, I pray you?",And why’s that?
619,But that you do not love me. I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.,"But you don’t love me. Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight."
620,"'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.","I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here. But I’ll see you soon."
621,Will you think so?,Do you really think so?
622,"Think so, Iago?","What do you mean, do I think so?"
623,"What, To kiss in private?","What, just because they kissed in private?"
624,An unauthorized kiss!,An illicit kiss!
625,"Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?","Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything."
626,"It is hypocrisy against the devil. They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.","Naked in bed together, but without doing anything? Come on, Iago. That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then back off. Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them."
627,"So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.","As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin. But if I gave my wife a handkerchief—"
628,What then?,Then what?
629,"Why then ’tis hers, my lord, and, being hers, She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.","Then it’s hers. And if it’s hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants."
630,She is protectress of her honor too.,Her reputation is also her own. Can she give that away too?
631,"Her honor is an essence that’s not seen, They have it very oft that have it not. But for the handkerchief—",You can’t see a reputation. A lot of people don’t even deserve the reputations they have. But a handkerchief—
632,"By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. As doth the raven o'er the infectious house, Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.","God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!"
633,"Ay, what of that?","Yes, what about it?"
634,That’s not so good now.,That’s not good.
635,"What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong? Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab—",What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there who have to brag about bedding some woman.—
636,Hath he said any thing?,Has he said anything?
637,No more than he’ll unswear.,"Yes, but he’d deny it all."
638,What hath he said?,What did he say?
639,"Why, that he did—I know not what he did.",He said he did—I don’t know.
640,What? what?,He what?
641,Lie—,He was in bed with—
642,With her?,With her?
643,"With her, on her, what you will.","With her, on top of her—however you want to say it."
644,"Lie with her? lie on her? We say “lie on her” when they belie her! Lie with her—that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labor. First to be hanged, and then to confess—I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is ’t possible? Confess!—Handkerchief!—Oh, devil!—","In bed with her? On top of her? I would have thought people were telling lies about her rather than believe he was lying on her. My God, it’s nauseating! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! I’ll kill him first, and then let him confess—I’m trembling with rage. I wouldn’t be trembling like this if I didn’t know deep down this was all true. Noses, ears, lips. Is it possible? Tell me the truth—Handkerchief—Damn it!"
645,"And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach.—What, ho! My lord! My lord, I say! Othello!","Keep working, poison! This is the way to trick gullible fools. Many good and innocent women are punished for reasons like this.—My lord? My lord, Othello!"
646,"How now, Cassio!","Hey, Cassio!"
647,What’s the matter?,What’s the matter?
648,This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.,Othello’s having some kind of epileptic fit. This is his second fit like this. He had one yesterday.
649,Rub him about the temples.,Rub his temples.
650,"No, forbear. The lethargy must have his quiet course. If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Do you withdraw yourself a little while,","No, don’t. This fit has to run its course. If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy. Look, he’s moving. Why don’t you go away for a bit? He’ll get"
651,He will recover straight. When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you.,"better right away. When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you."
652,"How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?","What happened, general? Did you hit your head?"
653,"I mock you not, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man!","Making fun of you? No, I swear! I wish you could face your bad news like a man!"
654,A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.,"A man who’s been cheated on isn’t a real man. He’s subhuman, like an animal."
655,"There’s many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster.",In that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city.
656,"Good sir, be a man, Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you. There’s millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better. To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.","Sir, be a man. Every married man has been cheated on. Millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them, wrongly believing they belong to them alone. Your case is better than that. At least you’re not ignorant. The worst thing of all is to kiss your wife thinking she’s innocent, when in fact she’s a whore. No, I’d rather know the truth. Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am."
657,"Oh, thou art wise! 'Tis certain.",You’re wise! That’s for sure.
658,"Stand you awhile apart, Whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— A passion most resulting such a man— Cassio came hither. I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,","Go somewhere else for a while. Calm down. While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here. I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance. I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would. So hide here and watch how he sneers"
659,"The which he promised. Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face. For I will make him tell the tale anew He hath, and is again to cope your wife. I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.","at you. I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future. I’m telling you, just watch his face. But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man."
660,"Dost thou hear, Iago? But—dost thou hear?—most bloody.","Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago? I’ll be very patient, but—do you hear me?—I’m not done with him yet"
661,"That’s not amiss, But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?","That’s fine, but for now keep your cool. Will you go hide?"
662,"Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A huswife that by selling her desires That dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one. He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.","Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes. She’s crazy about Cassio. That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one. Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing."
663,"And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behavior Quite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?","And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy. In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?"
664,The worser that you give me the addition,It doesn’t make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant. I’m dying to have that title back again.
665,"Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t. Now if this suit lay in Bianca’s power How quickly should you speed!","Just keep asking Desdemona, and it’ll be yours. If it was up to Bianca to get you your job back, you’d have had it already!"
666,"Alas, poor caitiff!",The poor thing!
667,Look how he laughs already!,He’s laughing already!
668,"Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves me.","The poor thing, I really think she loves me."
669,"Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.","Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off."
670,"Do you hear, Cassio?","Have you heard this, Cassio?"
671,"Now he importunes him To tell it o'er. Go to, well said, well said.","He’s asking him to tell the story again. Go on, tell it."
672,Do you intend it?,She says you’re going to marry her. Are you?
673,"Ha, ha, ha!","Ha, ha, ha!"
674,"Do ye triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?",Are you laughing because you’ve won? Do you think you’ve won?
675,"I marry her! What? A customer? Prithee bear some charity to my wit. Do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!","Me, marry her? That whore? Please give me a little credit! I’m not that stupid. Ha, ha, ha!"
676,Why the cry goes that you shall marry her.,"I swear, there’s a rumor going around that you’ll marry her."
677,Prithee say true!,You’re kidding!
678,I am a very villain else.,"If it’s not true, you can call me a villain."
679,Have you scored me? Well.,"Have you given me bastard children to raise? All right, then."
680,Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.,Iago is gesturing for me to come closer. Now he’s telling the story.
681,"She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck—","She was here just now. She hangs around me all the time. I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up. I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this—"
682,Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were. His gesture imports it.,"Saying, “Oh, Cassio,” it seems, judging by his gestures."
683,"So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes, and pulls me! Ha, ha, ha!","She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me. Ha, ha, ha!"
684,"Well, I must leave her company.",I have to get rid of her.
685,"Before me! Look, where she comes.","Look out, here she comes."
686,"'Tis such another fitchew. Marry, a perfumed one.— What do you mean by this haunting of me?","It’s a whore like all the others, stinking of cheap perfume.—Why are you always hanging around me?"
687,"How now, my sweet Bianca! How now, how now?","What is it, my dear Bianca? What’s wrong?"
688,"By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!","My God, that’s my handkerchief!"
689,"If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.","If you want to come have dinner with me, you can. If you don’t want to, then good riddance."
690,"After her, after her.","Go after her, go."
691,Will you sup there?,Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
692,"Yes, I intend so.","Yes, I will."
693,"Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.","Well, maybe I’ll see you there. I’d really like to speak with you."
694,"Prithee come, will you?",Please come. Will you?
695,"(advancing) How shall I murder him, Iago?","(coming forward) How should I murder him, Iago?"
696,Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?,Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
697,O Iago!,Oh Iago!
698,And did you see the handkerchief?,And did you see the handkerchief?
699,"Yours by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.","It was yours, I swear. And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him? She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore."
700,I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman!,"I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight. Oh, she’s a fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman!"

809,"Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, That true hearts cannot bear it.","He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it."

Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love. I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.

835,"Every day thou daff’st me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope.","Every day you put me off with some trick. Instead of finding opportunities for me, you seem to be preventing me from making any progress."
836,"I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.","Well, I won’t take it any longer. And I’m not going to sit back and accept what you’ve done."

838,"I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.",I’ve listened to you too much already. Your words and actions don’t match up.
839,"With naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.","It’s the truth. I’ve got no money left. The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me.

840,"Well, go to. Very well.","Well, all right then. Fine."

844,"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.","Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said."
845,"Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.","Well, all right then. Now I see that you have some guts. From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before. Give me your hand, Roderigo. Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you."
846,It hath not appeared.,It doesn’t look that way to me.
847,"Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?","Well, what’s your plan? Is it feasible?"
848,"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.",Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
849,"Is that true? Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.",Is that true? Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
850,"Oh, no, he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident—wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.","Oh, no. He’ll go to Mauritania and take the beautiful Desdemona with him, unless he gets stuck here for some reason. The best way to extend his stay here is to get rid of Cassio."
851,"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.","I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place."
852,And that you would have me to do!,And that’s what you want me to do!
853,"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste. About it!","Yes, if you want to help yourself. He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him. He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet. When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him. I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him. Come on, don’t stand there in a daze. Come along with me. I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out. It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted. Let’s go!"
854,I will hear further reason for this.,I want to hear more about this.
855,"I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.","Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself."

863,Dismiss me?,Send me away?
864,"It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia, We must not now displease him.","That’s what he said. So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight. We shouldn’t displease him."

Set you down this,","Wait. A word or two before you go. I’ve given the state of Venice a bit of help in the past, and they know it. But enough about that. When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am. Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility. If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it. I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy. Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didn’t know what it was worth. As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot.

Oh, enforce it! Myself will straight aboard, and to the state","(to IAGO) You bloodthirsty dog, you’re crueler than sadness or hunger, crueler than the sea. Look at these dead people on this bed. You did all this. He makes me sick. Take him away. Gratiano, take care of the house, and take the Moor’s property.
